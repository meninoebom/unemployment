General 
- Grading not implemented
- Progress bar is implemented in a simplified way only using the circular level icons

Level 2
- The informational popovers are not displaying at an optimal position for readability in relation to the viewport
- The percentages appearing on the piechart after the student answers a question correctly are not doing so in a way that grabs the students attention

Level 3
- State and county dropdown/search box is hard coded for Michagan/Kent/Livingston
- Bread crumbs are not navigable (should they be?)
- Right sidebar will not display labor force, employment, or natural unemployment percentages
- need to test the function determining the comparison between 2 counties on question 6. May be doing to much rounding
